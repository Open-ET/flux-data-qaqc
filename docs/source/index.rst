flux-data-qaqc - Tools for Energy Balance Closure Analysis
==========================================================

A Python module with tools for eddy covariance flux station data including:

* data validation with tools for quality-based filtering 
* energy balance closure correction routines
* time series data analysis, temporal aggregation, and resampling
* management of site metadata including for batch processing 
* interactive data visualizations

``flux-data-qaqc`` provides a framework to create reproducible workflows for the analysis of eddy covariance time series data. In particular for performing energy balance closure analysis and correction routines which adjust turbulent fluxes.
