The Energy Balance Ratio correction method was modified from the `FLUXNET2015
<https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/>`__ methodology for correcting daily latent energy and
sensible heat.  Additionally, FLUXNET and `AmeriFlux
<https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/>`__ eddy covariance data was used for code
development and we thank them for mantaining and providing eddy flux data.
