"""
Tools for performing energy balance correction and data validation of eddy covariance flux station data. Includes routines for adjusting near surface latent energy and sensible heat fluxes to improve closure of the energy balance, calculation of evapotranspiration, and potential clear sky radiation. Other functionalities include data processing e.g. temporal resampling and aggregation, unit conversions, cleaning data using quality control metrics, and interactive visualizations or input and output.
