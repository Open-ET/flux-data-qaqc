flux-data-qaqc
================

A Python package for correcting/validating the surface energy balance for `FLUXNET climate station data <https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org>`_ (or other climate station data) using techniques that adjust latent energy and sensible heat fluxes. Major functionality includes parsing of climate time series, performing QA/QC routines, and generating visualizations of corrected energy balance components and radiative-turbulent flux ratios at daily and monthly frequencies. The software is currently in early development. 

Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is in development, until then it is recommended to view the `FLUXNET_2015_example <https://github.com/Open-ET/flux-data-qaqc/blob/master/example_data/FLUXNET_2015_example.ipynb>`_ Jupyter notebook. The example includes explanations of multiple functionalities of `flux-data-qaqc` and utilizes a provided FLUXNET 2015 daily climate file.

Installation
------------
Currently clone or download from `GitHub <https://github.com/Open-ET/flux-data-qaqc/edit/master/README.md>`_ and use the package locally. Soon installation with PIP or Python will be provided. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/Open-ET/flux-data-qaqc.git
